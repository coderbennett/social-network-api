## Usage

The best way to view the web app is by using Insomnia and accessing the site through the deployed link <a href="https://joeys-social-media-api.herokuapp.com/api/users" target="_blank">here</a>.

Considering this is a back-end only API, I made a walkthrough video where I used Insomnia to access each get, put, post and delete route. Please watch the video below to see the full functionality:

## Technologies Used
This web app uses Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku and the dotenv node module. This web app also wouldn't be as easily accessible without the help of Insomnia.
